# NTRU Encryption System in Python
## Introduction
Welcome to the NTRU Encryption System in Python project! This repository houses an implementation of the NTRU encryption algorithm using Python. NTRU (Nth degree TRUncated polynomial) is a lattice-based asymmetric encryption system known for its efficiency and post-quantum security.
The goal of this project is to provide a simple, easy-to-understand, and efficient implementation of the NTRU encryption algorithm, allowing developers to utilize NTRU in their applications for secure communication and data protection.

## Features
* Key generation: Generate public and private keys for NTRU encryption.
* Encryption: Encrypt messages using the recipient's public key.
* Decryption: Decrypt encrypted messages using the recipient's private key.

## How to Use
* Clone the repository to your local machine:
```python
git clone https://github.com/rxnnae/NTRU-Cryptosystems.git
```
* Install the required dependencies:
  * operator module
  * fractions module
  * numpy module

* Run the ipynb file: NTRUmain.ipynb
